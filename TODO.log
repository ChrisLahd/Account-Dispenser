Things I need todo.

- Make the "addUser" command a category for cleaner code.
I might even be able to mash it into one command using string checking.

- Make the "addUser" command log the admin who adds the ClientID for further
moderation and easy access for logs.

- Make the "Generator" command accept users who don't have a whitelisted
ClientID so they can generate free accounts.
